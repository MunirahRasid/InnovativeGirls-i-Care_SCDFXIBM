InnovativeGirls consist of 2 members Munirah Rasid and Nur'idiawati


## Overview of Solution
To develop a mobile application, that allows the access to the data in the portal, a secure web-based tool, and an integration with the existing features of MyResponder app, to better alert the onset of incidents which require emergency response (e.g. Cardiac arrests, falls, unattended cooking fires etc,.) and mobilise CFRs for effective early intervention especially to the vulnerable populations. 

* This can be done by focusing on two aspects: 
1. To provide historical medical information of emergency patients (subject to voluntary consent) to assist and allow SCDF personnels and CFRs identify the best courses of emergency response earlier and improve patient outcomes through the enhanced mobile application. 
2. To better inform the CFRs and SCDF personnels, on the existing medical situation of the emergency patient, through a wearable device.

## Detailed solution

1. Install the mobile application from the apple/google store
2. Every elderly will need the wearable device to be worn

## Solution build (e.g. IBM Cloudant, IBM Cloud Functions, etc.)
Managed to come out the analytic portion but on different platform which is pandas-profiling. 
For the analytic portion, IBM Watson Studio and AutoAI can be implemented. (not working)
